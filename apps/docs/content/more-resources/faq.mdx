# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is DevFleet?

DevFleet is a coding agent that fixes bugs, writes docs, updates your app, and implements new features. It integrates with GitHub and works asynchronously. Submit a task, step away, and come back when it’s done. DevFleet is currently in preview.

## Is DevFleet free?

Yes, for now. During beta, DevFleet is free while we learn from usage. Pricing will come later; our focus today is improving the developer experience.

## How does DevFleet work?

Each task runs in a fresh secure virtual machine. DevFleet:

- Clones your repo
- Makes changes based on your prompt

## How does DevFleet run code, and what about security?

Tasks execute in secure, cloud VMs with internet access. Treat them like any shared compute environment.

You’re responsible for what runs. Follow these basics:

- Don’t commit secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials).
- Keep dependencies safe (use dependency audits and patch known CVEs).
- Be careful with third-party packages and shell commands.
- Review plans and diffs before merging.

DevFleet uses LLMs to operate on both code and non-code files in your repo.

## Can DevFleet run long-lived commands (e.g., npm run dev)?

No. Long-running processes (dev servers, watch scripts) aren’t supported for now.

## What languages does DevFleet support?

DevFleet is language-agnostic, we found the agents work best with popular languages and stacks. The final performance really depends on the agent you choose to use.

## Can I leave while it’s working?

Yes. DevFleet is asynchronous. After you submit a task, you can close the app.

## Can I change which repos DevFleet can access?

Yes. In GitHub:

1. Go to Profile → Settings
2. Open Applications (Installed GitHub Apps / Authorized OAuth Apps)
3. Find DevFleet and click Configure
4. Adjust repository access

Then refresh DevFleet; new repos will appear.

## Does DevFleet train on private repos?

No. DevFleet does not train on private repository content. Privacy is a core principle, and your private repos aren’t used to train models.
