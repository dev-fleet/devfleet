# Getting Started

DevFleet is a lightweight coding agent runner that helps you fix bugs, write docs, and ship features. It connects to GitHub, reads your codebase, and works **asynchronously** — so you can keep moving while tasks run in the background.

You bring your own API key and choose the agent (today: Claude Code; more coming). Run multiple tasks in parallel and review diffs/PRs when they’re ready. It also works on mobile.

This guide shows you how to set up DevFleet and run your first task.

## Create an account

1. Visit https://app.devfleet.ai
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.

## Connect GitHub

DevFleet needs acces to your repositories in order to work.

1. Select the organization you want.
2. Click install.
3. Choose _all_ or specific repos that you want to connect to DevFleet.
4. You will be redirected back to DevFleet. If not, try refreshing the page.

Once connected, you’ll be redirected to environment setup.

## Setup Environments

DevFleet runs in a virtual machines where it clones your code, and make the code modifications. You need to create an environment for the runs.

1. Pick a repository from the repo selector.

DevFleet will automatically create an environment for the repository with some defaults. You can change these later from the environments menu. We'll be adding more environment options in the future.

## Select Your Agent

Unlike large model providers, when you're using DevFleet, you're not locked to a single model. We let you pick the agent you want and use it without having any additional costs.

1. Select your agent (today: Claude Code; more coming)
2. Enter your API key
